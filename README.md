# 🤖 MyBot App  
### OOP2 Java University Project — 2022  

MyBot App is a Java application developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming 2 (OOP2) course.  
The system simulates an AI-powered robotics service platform where users can explore different types of smart robots, view their features, and customize their appearance.

This project demonstrates **solid OOP concepts**, clear class design, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and GUI interaction.
